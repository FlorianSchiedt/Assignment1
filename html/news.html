                Seperating the html from the css is a very useful thing to do. On the one hand it makes
                the files more readable and not as cluttered. On the other hand it makes it possible to
                reuse css and build a style from multiple files. For example in this assignment I used a
                style.css for the general style of the page and then added specific rules for the different
                parts where it was needed. Furthermore you can also just switch out the css without a problem
                when they are seperated. If the html markup is well done it should be easy to adapt another style.

                Open Graph is used to display links in a meaningful way on social media. By adding some
                meta information to the site it can be displayed in a meaningful way rather than just by
                displaying text to represent the link. I used only the required properties for this assignment
                (title, type, image, url) but even more can be used to display information about the page.

                Humans.txt is a file made to give credit to the creators of websites. It follows a standard format
                to be easily readable. I only have one entry in the /* TEAM */ category since I made the site
                myself. For the /* SITE */ I mentioned some of the software I used and some general information about the site.

                Robots.txt is a file made for bots that traverse your site. Examples of such bots are
                parts of a search engine such as google that index web pages. By adding rules in this document you
                can tell search engines to not index some or all of your pages. However malicious bots will ingore
                these rules. On my page I did what was asked of me in the assignment and told it to not index the
                contact page.
